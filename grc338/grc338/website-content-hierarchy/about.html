      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <h4>Dedicated to Freshness</h4>
      <p>Here at Crispish Café, we begin each morning at the crack of dawn, slicing fresh fruits and vegetables, baking muffins and whipping up our French toast batter from scratch. Everything is made to order and freshness is never compromised. We don't use heat lamps or deep fryers — we use only the finest ingredients possible for the freshest taste around. Proudly serving the Ventura community since 2012.</p>
