            <h1>Final project proposal</h1>
            
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            
            <p>Red Dirt Studio </p><!--Change it to the name of the company-->
            
            <p>Small pottery studio selling handmade creations from local artists and offering ceramics courses to the public. Part teaching studio, part contemporary ceramics gallery. Located in Monterey Bay, California.  </p><!--Short description of the company-->
            
            <h2>Target audience</h2>
            
            <p>Millenials or others who may be furnishing a home for the first time and want to purchase timeless, quality ceramic pieces and/or learn a new, fun skill. Older customers typically buy singlular specialty items while younger customers buy more sets of items. Younger customers tend to be the ones booking studio time and classes and are more active online so they are most likely to be repeat visitors to the website to view class schedules and news updates.  </p><!-- Who are the people who use this site? -->
           
            <p>Our clientele is either looking to purchase homeware or have an experience by throwing clay in our studio. Customers who purchase our ceramics are typically looking for lasting, quality products with a modern design and want to find what they are looking for quickly. People who book studio time or enroll in our courses primarily want to enjoy their time in the studio and then perhaps get a unique, personal creation out of it that is easy to come back and pick up after it has been fired in the kiln. </p><!-- What are their primary task and goals? -->
